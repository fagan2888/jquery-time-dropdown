jquery-time-dropdown
====================

This is a jQuery extension for a time picker that has a small <select> menu with a small number of times that should handle most cases, plus an "other time" option that allows any time to be entered.

I wrote this for my web site LaffQ.com, which allows comedians to enter their gigs. Most gigs start between 7 and 10 pm on the hour or half hour. To simplify the user experience, I wanted to have a small menu to handle 95% of the cases, with an "Other Time..." option for those rare afternoon gigs (or whatever).

It depends on jQuery (but *not* jQuery UI), and only uses the browser built-in widgets.
